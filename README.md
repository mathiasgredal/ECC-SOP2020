### ECDH Implementation in C++
This project implements the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman function, using a BigNum wrapper ontop of Mini-GMP.
Only Short-Weierstrass eliptic curves like NIST and SECP curves are supported.


To run this the following packages should be installed:

##### OpenSUSE:
```
sudo zypper install git gcc-c++ cmake extra-cmake-modules libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel 
```
